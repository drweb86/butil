# An Example Next.js app

Monorepos work with whatever framework you want. For us, we've made a very simple next app that:

- loads an index page
- fetches some data from the server
- is set up with `preconstruct`

To run it run:

```
yarn start:next
```

from the repo root, or:

```
yarn start
```

in the package.

Make sure you've also got the server running to see it working!

```
yarn start:server
```

from the root.
