Для меня и Тома важно следующее:
===========================================
Implemented simplicity
===========================================

1. Logs
Reduce spending time on logs
- removed option with configuring of logs location
- improved searching of errors in minimum log level
- highlighting them with red color
- opening log folder with 2 mouse clicks
[2.7]

2. Configurator
- removed 3 tabs
- removed 'save options' button
- removed tab 'about' to separate form
- removed confirmance "sure you want to close configurator"
[2.7]

3. Scheduling
- service became user oriented
- service should be replaced with ui program which does not require any permissions
