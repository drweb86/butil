Issues with priorities:

1. Win9x, Me does not support priorities AboveNormal and BelowNormal. However this OS does not support encrypting that's why they are not supported. 

Program logic in backup class sets Normal priority in this case

2. Idle priority blocks 'Stand by' mode of OS so should not be used in TRAY program. However in the console or other tools it can be used freely
