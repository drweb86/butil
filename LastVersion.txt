5.6.1.0

Fixes
! Subsequent encrypted or compressed backups were failing because sate could not be read.
! .Net Core 7 has issues with encodings in console. Transcoding of packer messages was dropped because it causes random crashes. It will mean - no longer packer in non-english messages can contain issues with encodings with non-english file names.
! Recovery scripts were saved to wrong folder.
- Samba share with spaces, user, password support was fixed
