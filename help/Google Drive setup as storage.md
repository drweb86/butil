# Google Drive setup as storage

Unfortunately it won't be possible to use Google Drive directly within the application because of a complicated setup of permissions to particular folder of Google Drive.

But it is possible to do it indirectly.

## Instruction

a. Create at Google Drive folder for backups, let's say, "backup".

b. Download (Google Drive for PC)[https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10838124].

c. Authorise in this application.

You will see that new drive is created with all your folders available.

Find at virtual drive folder "backup". Let's say its path will be "G:\backup".

It will help to save money for small size folders on Network Access Storage like Synology or similar. And prevent corporation from exploring and having access to your data at the same time.

e. Done.
