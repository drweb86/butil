<P>To speed up sending image to storages you can use parralel storage processing setting</P>

<H4>Software</H4>
<P>.Net virtual machine has size about 22Mb(for windows). Since Windows Vista it is in memory permanently.</P> 
<P>Tray application takes 12mb of memory. It does not affect much on performance.</P>
<P>If you want to improve performance of .Net applications please install Microsoft .Net Framework 3,5.</P>
<P>Another way to improve performance is to run file "app\bin\SpeedUp.bat" with administrative privileges.</P>
