<P><B>Backup</B> is making copies of data so that these additional copies may be used to restore the original after a data loss event.</P>
<P><B>Backup window </B> is The period of time when backups are permitted to run on a system is called the backup window. This is typically the time when the system sees the least usage and the backup process will have the least amount of interference with normal operations. The backup window is usually planned with users' convenience in mind. If a backup extends past the defined backup window, a decision is made whether it is more beneficial to abort the backup or to lengthen the backup window.</P>
<P><A name="cfsaeofd"><B>Copying files Selection and extraction of file data</B> stands for Making copies of files is the simplest and most common way to perform a backup. A means to perform this basic function is included in all backup software and all operating systems.</P>
<P><A name="pi"><B>Performance impact</B> All backup schemes have some performance impact on the system being backed up. For example, for the period of time that a computer system is being backed up, the hard drive is busy reading files for the purposes of the backup, and its full bandwidth is no longer available for other tasks. Such impacts should be analyzed.</P>
<P><A name="udrm"><B>Unstructured Data repository model</B> An unstructured repository may simply be a stack of floppy disks or CD-R/DVD-R media with minimal information about what was backed up and when. This is the easiest to implement, but probably the least likely to achieve a high level of recoverability.</P>
