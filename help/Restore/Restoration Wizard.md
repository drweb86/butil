# How Can I Restore The Data?

At first you should open Restoration Master(see picture 1). You can do this either from start menu or from Configurator.

Than you should open an image with button (1) and enter password in text box (2) if your image was password protected. You can skip entering password (in this case when password will be needed, master will ask you for it).

Than click on button (3). A new form will be opened(see picture 2)

In the list (2) all backuped items are visible. You can choose all items you want to restore by holding Ctrl and clicking with mouse on them. To begin restore you either can call context menu (1) on selected items or press button (3). However you can double click on any item and restoration of such item will begin.

There will be available 3 modes of restoration:
- **To special folder** type is stands for unpacking selected item from an image to selected folder;
- **As 7-zip archive** type is stands for unpacking selected item from an image to selected 7-zip archive. Encryption(if any) is saved during unpacking to archive;
- **To original location** type is stands for unpacking selected item from an image to original location with replacing of existing data. This is the most dangerous option.
